# This-Is-Why-Youre-Broke
Expense Tracker and Investment Calculator

## Objective
Have you ever sat down and calculated just exactly how much money you're spending on frivolous things each month? Each year? This app is the tough love that you needed to kick your financial life into high gear. This app will let you track all of your subscription services that are sucking money out of your pocket each month. It also lets you calculate the total value of your toys and items that you bought on a whim. You can then go to a calculator page and punch in the numbers to see all of that money that was burning a hole in your pocket COULD have turned into over time had you invested it wisely!! Isn't that fun??
