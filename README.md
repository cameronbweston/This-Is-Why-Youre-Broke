# This-Is-Why-Youre-Broke
Expense Tracker and Investment Calculator

## Objective
Have you ever sat down and calculated just exactly how much money you're spending on frivolous things each month? Each year? This app is the tough love that you needed to kick your financial life into high gear. This app will let you track all of your subscription services that are sucking money out of your pocket each month. It also lets you calculate the total value of your toys and items that you bought on a whim. You can then go to a calculator page and punch in the numbers to see all of that money that was burning a hole in your pocket COULD have turned into over time had you invested it wisely!! Isn't that fun??

## Technologies Used:
- Django
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- TailwindCSS
- JavaScript
- Postgresql

## Next Steps:
1. Clean up the CSS and make everything clean and pretty
2. Add animations to Chart JS and 

## Bugs To Be Addressed:
- Chart JS not rendering sometimes or renders points incorrectly

## Lessons Learned:
- MOST IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY: The Pareto Principle. 20% of your work will get you 80% of the results... Coming into this I didn't know Django as well as I thought I did. And on top of that I decided to incorporate Chart JS and Tailwind into it at the last minute without reading or understanding the documentation. With more prep and sharpening of the ax, this could have become what I envisioned.
- Plan, plan, plan. I wasted so much time on tweaks that I often lost sight of the bigger picture. 
- I often have a vision for a project but do not line out how to get from point A to B clearly enough
- Not really a fan of Django
- LEARN THE CSS BASICS BEFORE ATTEMPTING A FRAMEWORK LIKE TAILWIND
